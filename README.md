# ApacheBeam_DataEngineering_Assignment


Data Analysis and Processing Assignments
## This repository contains three assignments focused on data analysis, visualization, and data processing using various tools and technologies.

### Task 1: Advanced EDA using D3.js in Colab
Dataset: shopping_trends
1. Conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using D3.js visualizations.
2. Visualizations include scatter plots, histograms, pie charts, and more, offering insights into shopping trends.
3. Made use of interactive features to enhance the user experience and data comprehension.Medium: https://medium.com/@keerthana.parsa/eda-analysis-using-d3-js-visualization-9adf1f063084

### Task 3: Demonstrating Apache Beam Features in Colab
Dataset: water_portability

Demonstrated essential Apache Beam features including:
1. Pipeline I/O: Reading and writing data.
2. ParDo: Parallel processing of data.
3. Windowing: Segmenting data into discrete windows.
4. Triggers: Defining when results from a window should be produced.
5. Composite Transforms: Bundling multiple transforms for modularity.
